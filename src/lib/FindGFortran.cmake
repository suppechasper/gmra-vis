# - Check for the presence of GFORTRAN, G2C and F2C. The search for the libraries
#   is combined into a single CMake search script, since this will allow us to
#   also do some cross-checking if required.
#
# The following variables are set when GFORTRAN is found:
#
#  HAVE_GFORTRAN        = Set to true, if all components of GFORTRAN have been
#                         found.
#  GFORTRAN_EXECUTABLE  = Excutable of the GFortran compiler
#  GFORTRAN_INCLUDES    = Include path for the header files of GFORTRAN
#  GFORTRAN_LIBRARY     = Path to libgfortran
#  GFORTRAN_LIBRARY_DIR = Directory within which libgfortran is located
#  GFORTRAN_LFLAGS      = Linker flags (optional)
#
# The following variables are set when G2C is found:
#
#  HAVE_G2C       = Set to true, if all components of G2C have been found.
#  G2C_INCLUDES   = Include path for the header files of G2C
#  G2C_LIBRARIES  = Link these to use G2C
#  G2C_LFLAGS     = Linker flags (optional)
#
# The following variables are set when F2C is found:
#
#  HAVE_F2C       = Set to true, if all components of F2C have been found.
#  F2C_INCLUDES   = Include path for the header files of F2C
#  F2C_LIBRARIES  = Link these to use F2C
